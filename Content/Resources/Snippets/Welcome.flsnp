        <p>Organizations operating in cross-border markets must address the ongoing challenge of aligning global objectives with local requirements. Achieving competitiveness on a global scale requires the development of scalable offerings, consistent messaging, and the ability to leverage international growth opportunities. Concurrently, successful global operations depend on the capacity to adapt to local languages, cultural norms, regulatory environments, and stakeholder expectations.</p>
        <p>The principle of “think global, act local” serves as a strategic framework for meeting these demands. A key component of this strategy is the creation of documentation that remains effective and relevant across diverse geographic and cultural contexts.</p>

        <p>Included are recommendations related to authoring tools, content structuring, and post-localization quality assurance. A reference list of tools, frameworks, and applicable standards is also provided to support efficiency, consistency, and scalability in multilingual documentation processes.</p>
        <h3>Purpose of the guide</h3>
