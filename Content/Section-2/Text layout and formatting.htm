        <h2>Text layout and formatting</h2>
        <p>Effective text layout and formatting are crucial for creating documents that are visually appealing, easy to read, and professionally presented.</p>
        <h3>Key aspects of text layout and formatting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Text direction.</b> Support both left-to-right (LTR) languages (for example, English, Spanish) and right-to-left (RTL) languages (for example, Arabic, Hebrew). Ensure proper alignment and flow of text, UI elements, and navigation based on the language’s directionality.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Font support.</b> Select fonts that support the glyphs and diacritics of target languages. For example, ensure fonts include Cyrillic, Chinese, or Arabic characters as needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Date, time, and number formats.</b> Adapt formats to local conventions (for example, MM/DD/YYYY in the US vs DD/MM/YYYY in the UK; commas vs periods for decimal separators).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Currency and units.</b> Display currency symbols, placement (for example, $100 vs 100 €), and measurement units (for example, metric vs imperial) according to local standards.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Sorting and collation.</b> Implement language-specific sorting rules, as alphabetical order varies (for example, Spanish treats "ñ" as a separate letter; Chinese may sort by stroke count or pinyin).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Pluralization.</b> Support language-specific plural rules (for example, English has singular/plural, while Arabic has dual and multiple plural forms).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Gender and grammatical agreement.</b> Handle gender-specific text (for example, in French, adjectives change based on noun gender) and other grammatical nuances dynamically.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Accessibility.</b> Ensure text layout supports screen readers and other assistive technologies, with proper language tagging (for example, HTML lang attributes).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Dynamic UI adjustments.</b> Enable adaptable layouts (for example, resizable containers) to respond to text changes without disrupting the design.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Locale-specific formatting.</b> Apply locale rules for capitalization, punctuation, and quotation styles (for example, " " vs « »).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>​Best practices of text layout and formatting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Use appropriate line length.</b> Limit line length to around 50-75 characters to enhance readability and prevent reader fatigue.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Incorporate visual aids.</b> Use images, charts, and other visual elements to complement the text and aid in conveying information effectively. ​</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Ensure high contrast.</b> Maintain sufficient contrast between text and background colors to improve readability, especially for users with visual impairments. ​</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Use white space.</b> Incorporate adequate white space around text blocks to prevent clutter and improve focus. Adequate white space improves readability, emphasizes key elements, and enhances the overall aesthetic appeal.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Avoid overuse of formatting styles.</b> Use bold, italics, and underlining sparingly to avoid clutter and maintain the document's professional appearance. ​</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Test print layouts.</b> If the documentation is designed for print or has an options to be printed, print a draft to ensure that the layout, margins, and colours appear as intended in the physical format.</p>
            </li>
