        <h1>Format-specific aspects</h1>
        <p>Everything is ready for release—the code runs smoothly, the design looks sharp—but is the product truly ready for a global audience?</p>
        <p>If the product hasn’t been designed with internationalization in mind, it may turn out that the software and its documentation will require significant changes to support languages beyond English. This issue often arises when the code and content aren’t structured in ways that allow for easy localization.</p>
        <p>Localization is more than just about the mere translation of words from one language into another—it's about cultural awareness and adapting the software and its accompanying documentation to the preferences, habits, and expectations of the target users.</p>
        <p>For this purpose, make sure to bear in mind the following format-specific considerations:</p>
        <ul>

                <p><a href="Text externalization.htm">Text externalization</a>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>

                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="Code and Markup language.htm">Code and Markup language</a>
                </p>
            </li>
