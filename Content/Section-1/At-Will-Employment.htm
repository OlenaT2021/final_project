        <h1>Plain language</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-111publ274">The Plain Writing Act of 2010</a> defines plain language (or plain writing) as "writing that is clear, concise, well-organized, and follows other best practices appropriate to the subject or field and intended audience”.</p>
        <p>In other words, the goal of plain language is to simplify the "word soup" of overly complicated documents, contracts, guidelines, and agreements. Plain language does not diminish or dumb down the writing; it makes your message more understandable and helps readers find what they are looking for faster.</p>
        <p>Plain language emphasizes communicating the message efficiently and effectively. That is, making it as easy as possible for the audience to understand what you are trying to say.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Write for your reader, not for yourself.</b> Put yourself in your audience's shoes: If you read this text, what questions would you have? ​The audience definition works when you know who you are designing for, what they want to do, and what they know and need to learn.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Make your work scannable</b>. Structure information in a clear, logical order, using headings and subheadings to guide readers through the material. ​The structure works when readers can quickly and confidently find the information they are looking for.  Readers tend to skim through writing these days, rather than reading with a close eye. Headings, tables, and lists can be used to profound effect to help them find what they need.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Use clear and concise language.</b> Opt for simple words and short sentences to convey your message effectively. Use technical terms only when necessary and use them consistently. ​The language works when readers understand the words and grasp the intended message quickly and confidently.</p>

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Maintain consistent terminology and style.</b> Use a glossary and a style guide to ensure consistency in terminology throughout the documentation. Consistency aids translators and helps maintain a cohesive user experience across different languages.​</p>

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Write in the active voice.</b> Active voice often makes text more comprehensible by clearly identifying who performs the action. Passive voice is often awkward, it’s usually longer, and it makes readers work harder to translate. Use strong, active verbs, and structure your sentences in the following order: Subject&gt;Verb&gt;Object (SVO). For example, use "The team completed the project" instead of "The project was completed by the team."</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Use pronouns and conversational tone.</b> Engage readers by using pronouns like "you" and "we," and write as if you are speaking to them directly. ​</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Be concise. </b>Eliminate unnecessary words and focus on delivering essential information. Aim for an average of 20 words per sentence, and limit paragraphs to one topic and five sentences. ​</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Don't use jargon or excessive acronyms.</b> Spell out acronyms and initialisms the first time you use them.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Avoid idioms and meaningless modifiers/fluff.</b> Your reader's attention will wane if the language is too flowery.</p>
