        <h1>Graphics and visuals</h1>
        <p>Visual elements play a crucial role in capturing the audience’s attention and enhancing their understanding of complex concepts. Much like illustrations in a story, graphics complement written content by simplifying intricate information and making it more accessible.</p>
        <p>In professional and technical writing, commonly used visuals include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Graphs</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Charts</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Tables</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Photographs</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Diagrams</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Maps</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These visuals help readers grasp complex processes, identify trends in data, and quickly absorb key information. They also highlight important points and improve content engagement.</p>
        <p>When preparing software documentation for internationalization and localization, visuals can significantly enhance clarity and reduce reliance on lengthy text. However, they must be designed with <b>cultural adaptability</b> and<b> linguistic flexibility</b> in mind. Consider the following best practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Separate text from images.</b> Embedding text within images complicates the localization process, as each language requires a separate image version. Instead, maintain text as separate layers or captions, facilitating easier translation and reducing costs.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Allow space for text expansion. </b>Translated text may vary in length compared to the source language. Design your visuals and layouts with flexible spacing to accommodate these changes without compromising design integrity.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Support bidirectional text.</b> Languages like Arabic and Hebrew are read from right to left. Ensure that your visuals and user interfaces can adapt to bidirectional text, maintaining usability and aesthetic appeal across various writing systems.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Use culturally neutral graphics.</b> Symbols, icons, and images can carry different meanings across cultures. To avoid misinterpretation, opt for universally recognized visuals or conduct thorough research to ensure appropriateness in target locales.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Be mindful of symbols and colours.</b> Symbols, colours, and images may have different meanings across cultures. Consider their cultural interpretations, as they can vary significantly across different cultures. To ensure that visual elements are universally understood and convey the intended message, choose culturally sensitive colour schemes and symbols, and verify their meanings within the cultural contexts of the target audiences.​</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Test visuals with target audiences.</b> Before finalizing your documentation, conduct usability testing with representatives from your target locales to ensure that graphics and visuals are interpreted as intended and resonate appropriately.</p>
