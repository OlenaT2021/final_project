        <h1>Translation and localization workflow</h1>
        <p>One of the main parts of working with the document is the translation and localization process, which aims to transform source content into a target language and culture while preserving meaning, tone, and functionality. Within this workflow stage, a lot goes on behind the scenes and covers the following key activities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Translation.</b> Converting text from the source language to the target one, focusing on linguistic accuracy and fluency.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Localization.</b> Adapting content beyond translation to align with cultural, technical, and market-specific requirements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Internationalization.</b> Preparing source content to be localization-ready (for example, using Unicode, avoiding hard-coded text). This part is often done before translation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Cultural adaptation.</b> Ensuring content resonates with the target audience by addressing cultural nuances, humour, or sensitivities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Technical adjustments.</b> Modifying formats, layouts, or code (for example, for software UI or documentation) to support target languages, including RTL scripts or text expansion.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Quality assurance.</b> Verifying linguistic, functional, and cultural accuracy through reviews, testing, and feedback loops.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Collaboration.</b> Coordinating among translators, QA teams, SMEs, PMs, and clients to resolve issues and align on goals.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The translation and localization workflow is a structured, collaborative process which involves meticulous planning, execution, and quality assurance to adapt software, documentation, marketing materials, or other content to diverse global markets. Key stakeholders—translators, QA teams, SMEs, project managers, and developers—work together to address linguistic nuances, technical constraints, and cultural sensitivities. Central to this process are terminology management, style guides, and glossaries, which provide the foundation for consistency and precision.</p>
        <h3>General workflow</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Pre-translation </b>
                </p>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>PMs analyze source content (for linguistic challenges, cultural sensitivities, technical issues, and terminology needs), set up tools, and prepare glossaries and style guides which help translators follow brand tone and localization expectations. Style guides cover tone, grammar preferences, punctuation, and voice (formal/informal).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Developers ensure internalization readiness (for example, Unicode support, externalized strings).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>SMEs validate terminology and provide context.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Translation</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Translators review source content and flag unclear phrases or ambiguous wording, cultural references or nuances, inconsistencies in terminology or formatting.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Translators may use tools for raising queries, including TMS such as Smartcat, Crowdin or email/shared query sheets.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Translators submit queries to clarify ambiguities in the source text, context for UI strings or placeholders, acceptable variations or approved terminology.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Translators may also suggest alternative translations or flag potential errors in the source content.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A shared Q&amp;A database or style guide is created to avoid redundant queries and ensure consistency across the translation team.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>PMs coordinate the Q&amp;A process and monitor translator queries and resolution progress.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                        <p>QA team reviews translations for grammar, style, and adherence to glossaries via tools like Xbench or QA Distiller.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>QA team tests localized software/UI for issues like text truncation or encoding errors.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Native speakers or local SMEs validate translations for cultural and contextual accuracy.</p>

        <h3>Additional notes</h3>
        <p>Terminology management is central to the translation and localization workflow. Key aspects include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Term extraction.</b> Identify key terms from source content (technical terms, brand-specific words, or phrases).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Glossary creation.</b> Compile a bilingual/multilingual glossary with definitions, context, and approved translations.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Terminology database.</b> Use tools like SDL MultiTerm or MemoQ to store and share glossaries with translators.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Validation. </b>SMEs or clients review and approve terms to ensure accuracy and alignment with the brand voice.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Maintenance.</b> Update glossaries as new terms emerge or existing ones evolve.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
