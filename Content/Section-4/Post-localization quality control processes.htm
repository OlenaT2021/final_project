        <h2>Post-localization quality control processes</h2>
        <p>Post-localization quality control is the final stage in the localization workflow, ensuring that translated documentation is ready for release. The quality control phase verifies that this localized content meets all functional, linguistic, and formatting standards before it reaches end users. This process builds on the steps outlined in the <a href="Testing and QA for localized documentation.htm">Testing and QA for localized documentation</a> phase, which involves comprehensive linguistic, cultural, and functional checks to ensure translation accuracy and usability.</p>
        <p>The post-localization quality control stage also includes a final review, which confirms that all required corrections have been made, content is complete, and documentation is properly integrated into the product environment. It serves as a prerequisite to the <a href="Final validation and readiness for release.htm">Final validation and readiness for release</a> step, where key stakeholders sign off on content, packaging is verified, and materials are prepared for deployment. By identifying and resolving any remaining issues—whether technical, linguistic, or contextual—post-localization quality control helps maintain content consistency, reduces the risk of user-reported errors, and ensures a polished, professional end product.</p>
