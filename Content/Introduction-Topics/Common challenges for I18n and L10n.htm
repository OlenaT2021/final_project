        <h2>Common challenges for I18n and L10n</h2>
        <p>As companies expand globally, they face the dual challenges of internationalization (making products and services adaptable across cultures) and localization (adapting products to specific markets). While these processes serve different purposes, they share several fundamental challenges that can impact global success.</p>

Every language has a set of rules for formatting conventions and sorting order, ​neglecting which can lead to significant issues affecting user experience, data integrity, and overall effectiveness in target markets.</p>

        <p>Translation isn’t just about converting text from one language to another; it’s about localizing the message so it resonates culturally and linguistically with the audience..</p>
        <div class="example-ghost">
            <p> A poorly translated slogan or product name can confuse or offend, leading to massive losses. Like it happened to <b>Pepsi's “Come alive” Campaign in China</b></p>
            <p>In the 1960s, Pepsi's slogan<i> "Come alive! You're the Pepsi generation"</i> was translated for the Chinese market. However, the translation was interpreted as "Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave". This misinterpretation stemmed from a literal translation that didn't consider cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions in Chinese. The result was confusion and a negative reception among Chinese consumers, illustrating the pitfalls of inadequate localization.</p>
        </div>
        <p>So to meet these challenges, a comprehensive strategy is needed to address both the technology and cultural changes required for truly global products and services.</p>
