        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p><a href="https://csa-research.com/Blogs-Events/CSA-in-the-Media/Press-Releases/Consumers-Prefer-their-Own-Language">One out of ten customers</a> will not buy a product if it is not localized. Whether the local audience understands English or not, it is good for the business to provide it in new language versions to your international buyers.</p>
        <p>Akio Morita, the co-founder of Sony, coined a saying that has become the mantra for many businesses aiming for greater relevance in a fiercely competitive global economic landscape:</p>
        <p><cite>“Think globally, act locally”</cite>, where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>thinking globally means expanding the business beyond the home market and exploring new opportunities in different regions and countries;</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>acting locally means understanding the unique needs and preferences of customers in different regions and tailoring your products, services, and marketing strategies accordingly.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Local cultures involve much more than language. Different countries have their own ideas about how to do things and their own rules about what is acceptable and what isn’t.</p>
        <p>That’s why any software product, whether a web or mobile app, must align with the cultural, linguistic, legal, and other requirements of its target markets. To achieve this, the software needs to be adaptable to changes.</p>
        <p>By reason of that, GILT is important for businesses and organizations seeking to reach global audiences effectively. It’s made up of a set of processes through which companies can expand their reach, increase user engagement, enhance user experience across diverse markets, among many other benefits. So what is GILT?</p>
        <h3>What is GILT?</h3>
        <p>Simply put, <b>GILT</b> is an acronym for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> <b>G</b>lobalization (G11N) refers to a plenary process implying the growing interdependence of the world’s cultures, economies, and social frameworks, generated by cross-border trade and the exchange and flow of goods, services, technologies, investments, people, and information. </p>
                <p>In the context of the Translation and Localization industry, it describes the ‘going global’ business practice of adapting content services and products to global, foreign markets from the standpoints of cultural, linguistic, and stylistic adaptation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>I</b>nternationalization (I18N) implies the design and development of a content product or application to enable a streamlined localization and adaptation process for target audiences from linguistic, cultural and regional standpoints.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>L</b>ocalization (L10N) can be defined as the linguistic and stylistic adaptation of content for the target region, its languages, and cultural particularities to make it appropriate, easily understandable, and comfortable to use for a local native target audience.</p>
                <p>Localization requires in-depth knowledge of terminology and the specifics of the region and culture the localized content is intended for. Also, Localization requires modification of various aspects, such as the interface layout, numerical styles, local currencies, local time and date preferences, colours, units of measure, content, graphics, and art style.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>T</b>ranslation (T9N) can be defined as the literal word-for-word transformation of a source text into the target language, the first stepping stone on any content’s road towards a new audience, as it provides this new audience with the ability to understand the source text in their native language. </p>
                <p>A typical application scenario for translation is exact texts. Examples include technical and medical documentation, which focuses on specific terminology that must be converted from A to B.</p>
                <p>However, translation alone is not sufficient due to its word-for-word approach, in cases where the main focus is to deliver a message from language A to language B, hence the inextricable correlation with Localization.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although these four terms are often confused, each has a specific meaning that distinguishes it from the others. The following diagram shows how the four processes fit together.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Internalization, globalization, localization, or translation may be different concepts, but the terms are related and fit together as this diagram above illustrates.</p>
        <p>If the company wish to globalize its business, it needs internalization and localization first.</p>
        <p>Although similar at first sight, internationalization and localization aren’t the same. Internationalization aims to build globally-ready software that can easily adapt to any market’s cultural, linguistic, or legal requirements. Localization takes an internationalized product and adapts its contents (whether text, image, sound, or colour) to maximize its chances of success in the target market.</p>
        <p>Internationalization always comes first, and it makes localization easier. In many ways, internationalization can be thought of as building the structure of a piece of software so that it can be adjusted for different target markets, while localization is the process of actually doing so for a specific market.</p>
